# Hand Detection Model
This repository contains a hand detection model trained to recognize two hand gestures: the peace sign and the thumbs-up sign. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and is converted into a TensorFlow Lite format for easy deployment on various platforms, including mobile devices. The model was developed and trained through Google's Colab Web App. The TensorFlow Lite model can be easily deployed on mobile devices, embedded systems, or used in web applications for real-time hand gesture detection. Integration with applications can be achieved using TensorFlow Lite's Python API or through platform-specific SDKs.

# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to begin my journey of understanding machine learning and neural networks. All training data was labeled and taken by me with only two different hand gestures. 

# Example
The images below present the model detecting the thumbs up and peace sign through a webcam.
